Dig into working projects to learn more about how Laravel Streams can be used.

## Kitchen Sink

This project is a blank canvas with all the bells and whistles. Fun to explore but may not be fit for a new project stub due to the bells and whistles or general configuration.

- [Kitchen Sink](https://github.com/laravel-streams/streams)

## Todos App

A simple todos application with a decoupled backend using the [Streams API](/docs/api/introduction) and the [API Client](/docs/api/client).

- [Todos Backend](https://github.com/laravel-streams/todos-backend)
- [Todos Frontend (Vue)](https://github.com/laravel-streams/todos-vue-app)
- [Todos Frontend (React)](https://github.com/laravel-streams/todos-react-app)
