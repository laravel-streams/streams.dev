## Contribution Guide

Thank you for considering contributing to the Streams platform! Please review the entire guide before submitting a bug report or pull request.

### Bug Reports

We very much encourage pull requests, not just bug reports.

A "Bug Report" should contain a title and a clear, detailed description of the issue. You should also include as much relevant information as possible and a code sample that demonstrates the problem. Bug reports intend to make it easy for yourself and others to replicate the bug and develop a fix.

Remember, bug reports intend to promote collaboration with others experiencing the same problem to fix the bug in question. Do not expect that the bug report will automatically see any activity or that others will jump to fix it. Creating a bug report serves to help yourself and others start on the path of fixing the problem.

## Which Repository?

Please send all *issues* to the [streams/streams](https://github.com/laravel-streams/streams) repository to help us keep them consolidated.

Send all *pull requests* to the respective repository they apply to and the branch as described below.

## Which Branch?

Kindly send all bug fixes to the latest stable branch. Bug fixes should never be sent to development branches unless they fix issues found exclusively in the upcoming release.
 
Send all minor features that are fully backward compatible with the current release to the latest stable branch.

Send all significant new features to the development branch, which contains the upcoming Streams release.

If you are unsure if your feature qualifies as a major or minor, please ask Ryan Thompson in the [#general Discord channel](https://discord.gg/NsEcFQM).

## Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability within our project, please send an e-mail to Ryan Thompson at security@streams.dev for prompt handling.

## Coding Style

The Streams platform follows the PSR-4, PSR-2, and PSR-1 coding standards.
